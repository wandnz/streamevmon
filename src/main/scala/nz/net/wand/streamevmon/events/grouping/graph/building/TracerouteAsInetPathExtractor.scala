/** Receives a stream of Traceroute measurements, and outputs one AsInetPath

  * process).
  *
  * The second input is a stream of TracerouteMeta entries. It is expected that
  * each Traceroute input will have a corresponding TracerouteMeta that belongs
  * to the same stream, but it is not required that the TracerouteMeta arrives
  * first. Any Traceroute measurements that were received before the
  * corresponding TracerouteMeta are buffered and processed when the Meta
  * is received.
  *
  * If a TracerouteMeta is received that is part of a stream we already have an
  * entry for, it is simply used from then on, overwriting the previous entry.
