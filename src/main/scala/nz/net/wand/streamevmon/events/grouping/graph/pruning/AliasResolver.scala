/** Worker class for alias resolution, which finds duplicate entries for hosts.
  *
  * Note that the `mergedHosts` field has no way of pruning itself, and will
  * grow endlessly.
  *
  * ==Configuration==
  *
  * This class configures the construction of a new
  * [[nz.net.wand.streamevmon.events.grouping.graph.itdk.ItdkAliasLookup ItdkAliasLookup]]
  * object if the constructor with a ParameterTool is used. As such, the default
  * config key group is `eventGrouping.graph.itdk`.
  *
  * - `alignedNodesFile`: If the file exists, the created AliasLookup will refer
  * to its contents.
  * - `nodesFile`: If the above file does not exist, but this one does, and the
  * `preprocessIfMissing` argument is set to true, then the file referred to by
  * this config element will be preprocessed, and its results used with a new
  * AliasLookup. This is likely to take a long time, so it's recommended to
  * preprocess these files separately using the entrypoint of
  * [[nz.net.wand.streamevmon.events.grouping.graph.itdk.ItdkLookupPreprocessor ItdkLookupPreprocessor]].
  *
  * @param itdkAliasLookup If provided, the ITDK dataset is used to perform more
  *                        advanced alias resolution.
